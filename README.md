# RepEnrich analysis on B cell lymphoma RNA-Seq
RepEnrich analysis on paired end RNA-Seq data


*****************************************
Step by step tutorial for dummies that have no idea how to make their way into operating shell environment and R studio console

Before starting you should ask any kind bioinformatician that is wiling to help you to share some space on your institution's server with you. The kind altruist should also make sure you will not do any damage to the folders situated outside of your own:)
I personally used Fila Zilla to download the raw RNA-seq files into the server. It should be linked to the server you operate in (if unsure how to do it, where to get the IP address just ask the altruist bioinformatician that set you up in the first place). In File Zilla, go to the icon on the left top corner (Open the Site Manager), here you can link to the correct server number and port number, set up your username and passord and make sure you are using the correct protocol for entry: SFTP: SSH File Transfer Protocol. Thats all you really need. These parameters should be saved up for your next log on. It will allow you to access the shell using Putty with the login and password that you have chosen. In File zilla you can actually create folders and just drag and drop your raw data so its available for the analysis, it may take a while.
Download Putty to operate within the shell environment, log in with a user name and passord that you had set up.
Yay- you are in! Congratulaitons on your first empty black screen!
